# FarmFrame ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

## Description

Farmframe is a simple companion to Warframe, Digital Extremes' popular massively multiplayer game. One of the core parts of Warframe is gathering the materials to craft its signature suits of armor, weapons, and other items. These materials come from a wide array of sources, and it can be difficult to keep track of which materials come from where.

This is where FarmFrame comes in. Drawing directly from Warframe's items API, FarmFrame gives you a completely searchable reference at your fingertips, giving you access to drop rates and info on items, mods, warframes, and weapons in a simple, easy to use format.

NOTE: This app is still in development. Updates will be noted here, when available.
